        <h2> Music</h2>
        <ul id="interest-list">
          <li class="background-gray">Piano</li>
          <p>
            Piano is a big part of my life. I started playing the piano in the age
            of 10. I continued with finishing all the degrees and studying music arts
            and piano in the univercity. Later on, i became myself a piano teacher and
            hopefully i will stay forever a piano enthusiast.
          </p>
          <li class="background-gray">Music Production</li>
          <p>
            Parralell to the piano and the classical direction, i have a great interest
            for electronic music and i am producing since almost 10 years now, trip
            hop and ambient tracks.
          </p>
          <li class="background-gray">Record Collection</li>
          <p>
            I collect records as other people might collect beer caps, hats or
            fridge magnets. When it comes to listening, i consider my listening
            versatile and i have records from Nigerian Funk to Japanese Disco and
            from traditional Greek music to Detroit Tehno.
          </p>
        </ul>
        <h2> Cooking</h2>
        <p>
        I enjoy cooking and improvising when it comes to recipe development.
        Japanese Cuisine is my favorite and i'm trying constantly to learn
        tricks, techniques and ingredients from the locals.
        </p>
        <h2> Travelling with my dog</h2>
        <img src="images/Oslo.jpg" alt="Oslos Face" id = "Oslo">
        <p> I am fortunate enough to have Oslo arriving in my life. As every
        dog owner, i claim that he is the smartest and most beautiful dog ever existed.
        We love traveling together and exploring hidden gems and untrailed parts of
        the nature with skiing being our favorite sport.
